# Admin Interface

## Overview

The Arrigoo CDP Admin Interface is a web-based control panel that allows administrators and analysts to explore and manage customer data, define audiences, track events, and automate actions. It is designed to provide both high-level insights and fine-grained control over how data is collected, organized, and activated.

The interface is divided into several sections accessible via the left-hand sidebar, including Dashboards, Profiles, Segments, Events, Properties, Actions, and Integrations. Each section plays a role in helping you understand your users and use your data more effectively.

This documentation provides an overview of each part of the admin interface, including descriptions, typical use cases, and visuals to guide you through its functionality.
